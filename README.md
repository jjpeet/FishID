## Identify Fish in QLD waters

This project is an Open Data project providing a simple interface to identify fish found in the waters of Queensland, Australia

Open data API found here;
https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/fisheries-species-identification

I'm using this project to gradually learn Javascript, Bootstrap, Angular etc
